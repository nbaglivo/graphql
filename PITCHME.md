# GraphQL

Disclaimer: This is not a technical thing, just presents a problem and a possible solution. Also I'm not and expert and this need more work.

@title[fundamental]


### This starts with a simple question:

In terms of what data matters... Who knows better? The server or the client?

Take netflix for example.

@title[how it works]

### What if you could ask for what you need and get exactly that
Build a query and send it to the server.
The server gives you back a JSON.

@title[what's it]

### So what's GraphQL?

* An open spec for a flexible API layer.
* A data query language.

### Setup the server

We're going to use Express

@title[setting_server]


```
import express from 'express';
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

import schema from './graphql/schema';

var app = express();

// GraphqQL server route
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP(req => ({
  schema,
  pretty: true
})));
```

@title[schema]

### GraphQL schema

A GraphQL schema is nothing else than a group of queries, mutations and subscriptions.

* Queries: Things we can query for, dah.
* Mutations: Things that we can modify.
* Subscriptions: Things that I can subscribe of (so I can get push messages and react instead of pooling)

```
// ./graphql/schema.js
export default new GraphQLSchema({
  query: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Query',
    fields: {
      ...userQueries,
      ...todoQueries
    },
  }),
  mutation: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Mutation',
    fields: {
      ...userMutations,
      ...todoPostMutations
    },
  }),
});

        name: 'itemId',
        type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLInt)
      }
    },
    resolve: (root, { id }, source, fieldASTs) => {
      let projections = getProjection(fieldASTs);
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          ToDoMongo.find({ id }, projections,(err, todos) => {
              err ? reject(err) : resolve(todos)
          });
      });
    }
  }
}

@title[schema_types]

### Types

* Are used to ensure Apps only ask for whatâ€™s possible.
* You can perform validation you can provide clear and helpful errors.
* You can derive them from Mongoose with some extra package. (probably not the best idea though)

---

@title[schema_types_definition]

```
// ./schema/todo/type.js
export default todoType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'todo',
  description: 'todo item',
  fields: () => ({
    id: {
      type: (GraphQLInt),
      description: 'The id of the todo.',
    },
    item: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'The name of the todo.',
    },
    completed: {
      type: GraphQLBoolean,
      description: 'Completed todo? '
    }
  })
});
```

---

@title[va;idation]

### Validation

If you perform an invalid query like this:

```
{
  todo {
    isCompleted // The real name is "completed"
  }
}
```

---

@title[va;idation_error]

You will get:

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot query field \"isCompleted\" on type \"Todo\".",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 4,
          "column": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

@title[versions]

### GraphQL has no version notion.

Whaaaat?

Suppose we have this

```
var UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    name: { 
      type: GraphQLString, 
      deprecationReason: 'We split up the name into two'
    },
    firstname: { type: GraphQLString },
    lastname: { type: GraphQLString }
  }
})
```

... and we want to deprecate the name field in favour of firstname and lastname

---

@title[versions]

We can do this:

```
var UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    name: { 
      type: GraphQLString,
      deprecationReason: 'We split up the name into two'
    },
    firstname: { type: GraphQLString },
    lastname: { type: GraphQLString }
  }
})
```

@[6](Add deprecationReason)
@[8](Add field firstname)
@[9](Add field lastname)

@title[demo]

### Quick demo time with GraphiQL

---

@title[advantages]

### Advantages

* Avoid several roundtrips, you can get many resources in a single request.
* No need for ad-hoc endpoints.
* Evolve your API without versions which makes devilering features faster
* Can be built on top of your existing infrastructure: REST, SOAP, existing databases, or anything else.
* A lot of tools.
