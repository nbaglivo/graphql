# GraphQL

Disclaimer: This is not a technical thing, just presents a problem and a possible solution. Also I'm not and expert and this need more work.

### This starts with a simple question:

In terms of what data matters... Who knows better? The server or the client?

@title[how it works]

### What if you could ask for what you need and get exactly that
Build a query and send it to the server.
The server gives you back a JSON.

### Let's do some coding

---

@title[code_1]

```
import express from 'express';
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

import schema from './graphql';

var app = express();

// GraphqQL server route
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP(req => ({
  schema,
  pretty: true
})));
```

@title[advantages]

### Advantages

* Avoid several roundtrips, you can get many resources in a single request.
* No need for ad-hoc endpoints.
* GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for whatâ€™s possible and provide clear and helpful errors.

@title[more_advantages]

### More advantages

* Evolve your API without versions (you can still deprecate things).
* Can be built on top of your existing infrastructure: REST, SOAP, existing databases, or anything else.
* A lot of tools.
